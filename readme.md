This Streamlit app allows you to generate AI-generated content based on a user prompt and an uploaded image using the Google GenerativeAI library. You can use this app to create creative descriptions or text based on the content of the uploaded image.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this Streamlit app, you need to obtain a Google API key. You can follow the instructions on how to get an API key from the [Google GenerativeAI documentation](https://generativeai.github.io/docs/getting-started).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihteshamjahangir/ai-vision-streamlit-app.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash

cd ai-vision-streamlit-app
Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended).
bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies.
bash
Copy code
pip install -r _requirements.txt
Configuration
Before running the app, you need to set your Google API key as an environment variable. You can export it in your terminal or set it in your environment.

bash

export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
Alternatively, you can create a .env file in the project directory and store your API key there.


GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
## Usage
Run the Streamlit app.

streamlit run app.py

The app will open in your web browser.

In the app, you'll see the following options:

Enter a prompt...: Enter a prompt or text that you want to use for generating content.
Upload an image: Upload an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
Click the "Generate" button to initiate the content generation process.

If you provided both a prompt and an uploaded image, the app will use the AI model to generate content based on these inputs.

The generated content will be displayed in the app, and you can view the AI's response.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the AI Vision Streamlit App:

Prompt: "Describe this image."
Upload an image: Select an image from your local machine.
The AI will generate a description of the uploaded image based on your prompt.
